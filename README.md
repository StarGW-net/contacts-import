A free simple Foreign Exchange Rate Currency app. Clean interface, free rates and no adverts.

Get 24hour rates free from the ECB or sign up for a free Open Exchange Rate account and receive hourly rates from more currencies.

Set Exchange rate Notifications and get alerts.

5 styles of widgets to chose from. 

After a number of years I have stopped releasing and supporting apps on Google Play and have now moved all my apps to F-Droid.

TODO: Currently I use AlarmManager to update the currency rates every hour. This can sometimes fail if the network is not ready. I should probably switch to using WorkManager.
